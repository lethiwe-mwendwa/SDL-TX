# SDL-TX
SDL-TX (SDL Teti Extension), is a collection of common general functions I always end up making in SDL projects. Hoping to use this to streamline my future game creation endeavours
and perhaps help others that already have an understanding of SDL and meerly want to use my tool. Credit me if used.
