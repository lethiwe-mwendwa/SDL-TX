# SDL-TX
SDL-TX (SDL Teti Extension), is a collection of common general functions I always end up making in SDL projects. Hoping to use this to streamline my future game creation endeavours
and perhaps help others that already have an understanding of SDL and meerly want to use my tool. Credit me if used.

# Origins
When working on my very first SDL2 Project (Chess X-Press, to be revealed soon ;) ), I found myself making functions that I realized were very general and could be used in future projects; such as rendering an image relative to a specific position in the screen, whilst also making sure the sizing is a constant ratio no matter the screen size.
I coded that twice, and smacked my head in dissapointment, and here we are. Finally organising all my little functions, but also making them a bit more advanced and enabling easy configuration.

#Goals
Make it so I barely have to interact with SDL directly :D
Ambitious, I know, but fun and challenging!
